 <h1>Competitive-Coding</h1>
 
 <h3>If you want to contribute here, there are certain rules to follow: </h3>
 <ul>
 <li>You can use C++, Python and Java only to contribute here</li>
 <li>Please add the input-output section as well (take reference from already published programs)</li>
 <li>Please don't contribute those algorithms which are already present there (will be waste of time for you)</li>
 <li>Please try to write the modular code as much as you can (dividing code into sections/functions)</li>
 <li>Please raise an issue first to add a new file/algorithm</li>
 <li>If you have the optimised code for any of the algorithms then please name the file with the name of algorithn long with language and add "optimized" in the name.
 </ul>
 
 <h1>Happy Coding!!</h1>
